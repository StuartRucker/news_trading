Adidas launched its new sports-bra campaign today with an unusual image: a grid of 25 sets of bare breasts. Aside from the surprise factor of the nudity, the breasts shown are only remarkable because they are completely normal. These are real breasts in all their perky, saggy, asymmetrical, varied forms."
