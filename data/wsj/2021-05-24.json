Some Jews elected conversion to survive in 14th- and 15th-century Spain. Others did so for economic and social mobility, as attempted by the families of Benjamin Disraeli and Felix Mendelssohn, and by Gustav Mahler himself, or were motivated by real belief, as with Jean-Marie (born Aaron) Lustiger, Archbishop of Paris from 1981 to 2005, who proudly described himself as a Jew.

Today, Darren Julien, the owner of Julien's, an 18-year-old auction house that frequently hosts sales of celebrity possessions, believes the same grungy sweater could perhaps fetch double that amount. \"I've had offers of $500,000 to $700,000 to get the buyer to sell it,\" he said.
