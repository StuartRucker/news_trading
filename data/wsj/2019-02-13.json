Dimayuga, 33, ran the kitchen at Mission Chinese Food's Manhattan location for six years and says her new role at Standard International-ranging from conceptualizing fundraising dinners to choosing DJs for an upcoming bar opening-speaks to how she needed to broaden her own mission as a chef. \"I wanted to do something nobody expected of me,\" she says, \"and that I didn't expect of myself.\" Among her first changes have been installing chef Max Blachman-Gentile at Narcissa in The Standard East Village, where his bread program is already drawing attention. She's also readying three new dining concepts at The Standard London, the brand's first-ever international property, slated to open this spring. Its pub, Double Standard, will mesh British and American sensibilities. A garden restaurant called Isla, helmed by Adam Rawson, will feature coastal-inspired cuisine. And a 10th-floor space will offer the open-fire cuisine of Michelin-starred chef Peter Sanchez-Iglesias. \"People ask me if I miss cooking every night,\" says Dimayuga. \"I'm designing dishes now with people I admire.
