She traveled with an all-female entourage. In short, she cultivated celebrity at a time when there were no true American celebrities and she successfully maneuvered the dangerous line between the kind of notoriety that merely titillated (was she or was she not a lesbian?) and the kind that might have killed her career (no one, at that time, could be entirely sure).", "categories": [["Books & Arts", "Books", "Bookshelf"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts/books?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/bookshelf?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-profit-sags-under-pressure-from-satellite-tv-covid-19-11595503520", "title": "AT&T Profit Sags Under Pressure From Satellite TV, Covid-19", "date": "2020-07-23 19:02", "summary": "Initial sign-ups for HBO Max show most HBO customers have yet to upgrade their older accounts; 'We still have work to do'.
