He notes that Supreme Court decisions construing the Constitution's Spending Clause permit the federal government to offer states grants for purposes that are the exclusive responsibility of the states, so long as it doesn't coerce them into accepting them and all their attendant baggage. Experience has demonstrated that the states find it enormously difficult to decline them, whatever their conditions. That is true even though 14 states refused to participate in ObamaCare's expansion of Medicaid coverage, but that is an exception that proves the rule. Having experienced the very substantial collateral costs of their existing Medicaid programs, those states declined to compound them.
