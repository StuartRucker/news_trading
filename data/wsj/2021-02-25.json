In theory, it shouldn't be impossible to webcast a musical, but it's technically very difficult-too many people, too much stuff going on-and the only one I've reviewed, the Irish Repertory Theatre's wonderful revival of \"Meet Me in St. Louis,\" was a scaled-down version in which the actors \"phoned in\" their performances, taping them from their separate homes, after which they were edited together in the studio. So it is inspiring to report that Virginia's Signature Theatre, one of the top American regional theaters that specialize in musicals, is webcasting \"Simply Sondheim,\" a fully-staged 33-song revue directed and choreographed by Matthew Gardiner and performed in the company's empty 275-seat theater by 12 singers and a 15-player pit orchestra. No, it's not \"Sweeney Todd\" on a Broadway-sized stage, but it is fabulously fine in its own right and comes across with irrepressible vitality on a small screen.", "categories": [["Opinion", "Theater Review"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/opinion?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/theater-review?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-treasury-yields-rise-after-positive-jobs-data-11614274559", "title": "U.S. Treasury Yields Rise After Positive Jobs Data", "date": "2021-02-25 16:17", "summary": "Move extends a recent climb in government bond yields.
