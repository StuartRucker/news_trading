In \"Consider the Platypus\" (Black Dog & Leventhal, 272 pages, $29.99), science journalist Maggie Ryan Sandford examines this curious species and more than 40 others of particular interest to the study of evolution. Ms. Sandford accords each animal its own dossier, including color illustrations, timelines, text boxes and other graphic elements. In cheery, pun-filled prose, she reviews the physical characteristics of the species, sketches its development and considers the evolutionary lesson it has to teach. One recurring theme is the unlikely similarities between us and our fellow animals. Strange though it may seem, human beings and giraffes (in fact, all mammals except the sloth and the manatee) have seven vertebrae in the neck. Our simplest living relative, it turns out, is probably the Great Barrier Reef demosponge, a creature so simple that it \"barely looks like an animal, and it even leaves something to be desired as a sponge.\" Still, some 70% of the demosponge's genome finds direct parallels in our own.

As the Beatles and the Rolling Stones were to music during the \"Swinging '60s,\" so Mary Quant was to women's fashion: a cheeky global pop sensation synonymous with postwar Britain's smashing the boundaries of class. \"Mary Quant\" (V&A Publishing, 224 pages, $45), the copiously illustrated catalog of an exhibition on view at the Victoria and Albert Museum through Feb. 16, describes the now-85-year-old designer's humble origins in wartime London and her early interest in sketching clothes at Goldsmiths College. There she met her future husband and business partner, the aristocratic Alexander Plunket Greene; they were soon joined by a marketing whiz named Archie McNair, and in 1955 together opened Bazaar, an immediately popular shop in Chelsea. The Quant \"look\" took shape in the late 1950s and early '60s-youthful, liberated, practical and, most of all, showing a whole lot of leg. If Ms. Quant did not invent the miniskirt, she gave the garment its name, and also pioneered such innovations as patterned tights, hot pants, floppy hats, and dresses modeled on soccer jerseys. Her Ginger Group, a wholesale-company spin-off, offered licensing rights world-wide and led to mass production of Quant designs, making them widely available and affordable. Catalog essays touch on other phenomena of the period that solidified the brand: fashion photographers David Bailey and Norman Parkinson, reedy but glamorous models Jean Shrimpton and Twiggy, and the Vidal Sassoon \"five-point\" haircut. The designer wanted \"fun\" above all, and \"Mary Quant\" vividly captures the high spirits of the age while charting one woman's genius and wide-ranging ambitions.", "categories": [["Books & Arts", "Books", "Bookshelf"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts/books?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/bookshelf?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-movie-musical-review-thats-entertainment-11574441984", "title": "'The Movie Musical!'
