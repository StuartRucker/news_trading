The first starof \"Animal Babies: First Year on Earth\" (begins Wednesday, 8 p.m., PBS) is elephant calf Safina, born in Kenya. She's just a few hours old, 3 feet tall, 200 pounds in weight, and she's been in her mother's womb for two years-all information irrelevant next to the sight of her, which is both irresistible and slightly nerve-racking, especially when she tries, a few hours later, to begin walking with the elephant herd as it looks for food and water, which she must learn to do. The offspring of Cyclone, the herd matriarch, Safina has much to live up to already, and also something for which she might well be grateful if elephant babies had the time to consider such things-namely, that she has been born to a parent who enjoys high status in the herd. This, the creators of this extraordinary film emphasize, is a proven advantage, one that increases the chances of a newborn's survival.", "categories": [["Books & Arts", "Television Review"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/television-review?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/incompetent-newark-turns-to-feds-on-lead-11566507645", "title": "Incompetent Newark Turns to Feds on Lead", "date": "2019-08-22 17:00", "summary": "Flint and Newark's water suppliers did not follow the EPA's lead and copper regulation of 1991, and failed to monitor appropriately and control the corrosiveness of the water, at least in part of the city in Newark's case..
