Plus: Japan's rapidly rising visitor numbers. THE 19TH-CENTURY FOREIGNERS who first ventured to the Japanese mountain town of Nikko came away enchanted by the scenery: ornate Shinto shrines set among rivers, forests and waterfalls. But those same visitors were less impressed with the lodging options. Many griped about the local inns, furnished with futon-beds set on the floor and paper walls that offered no privacy. And the food? Overly exotic at best. British traveler Isabella Bird offered a typical review: \"The fishy and vegetable abominations known as 'Japanese food' can only be swallowed and digested by a few, and that after long practice.\" In 1873, in an attempt to cater to Western sensibilities, Zenichiro Kanaya, a 21-year-old temple musician, opened rooms in his family house, serving guests simply-prepared poultry, rainbow trout and eggs. Two decades later, Mr. Kanaya established the first European-style resort hotel nearby, with two stories, mattress beds and such Western staples as bread, which guests had taught his chefs to bake. By 1896, the Kanaya Hotel was turning out 14-course French menus with beef in P\u00e9rigueux sauce and champignons au jus-not a piece of sushi or grain of rice in sight. Throughout the early 20th century, the hotel drew a parade of celebrity travelers, including the Japanophile Frank Lloyd Wright and, later, Albert Einstein and his wife, Elsa. The hotel gardens, sculpted by temple workers, fit in with the local aesthetic, while the kitchen continued to appease American and European palates, with bacon and eggs for breakfast and mille-feuille after dinner.", "categories": [["Life & Work", "Travel", "Off Duty Travel"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/life-work?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/magazine/travel?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/off-duty-travel?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-middle-class-person-is-dying-pakistans-tax-push-is-deflating-its-leaders-political-base-11571313603", "title": "Pakistan's Tax Push Deflates Leader's Political Base", "date": "2019-10-17 08:00", "summary": "Resume Subscription.
