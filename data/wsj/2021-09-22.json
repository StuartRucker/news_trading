When Trans World Airlines Flight 800 exploded and crashed on a summer evening in 1996 shortly after taking off from JFK airport-killing all 230 people on board-conspiracy theories abounded. Some eyewitnesses claimed to have seen a streak of light preceding the crash, prompting speculation about missiles or meteors. After four years of investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that explosive fuel vapors had been ignited, perhaps by an electrical failure. In July-25 years after the crash-artist Taryn Simon traveled from her home in Manhattan with a large-format camera to record a 93-foot section of the reconstructed plane, on display in a hangar in Ashburn, Virginia, before it will be destroyed, which is set to happen per the wishes of the victims' families. (The NTSB will first create a 3-D scan of each piece of debris and archive the data.) For Simon, photographing the plane is about honoring it as a site of grief. \"For me it was initially thinking about memorial and remembrance and the journey from reconstruction to archive, which mimics in some ways the grieving process,\" says Simon, 46. \"There's this kind of slow or painstaking putting together of what happened and coming to terms with it. And the assembly of all that confounds logic in the process.\" Simon hasn't decided whether to exhibit the images in the future. \"The families' wish for the plane to be destroyed rather than turned into a public exhibition expresses a preference for one kind of loss-to lose the physical relic-over another, which is to lose a private memory to public curiosity,\" Simon says. \"Photography can play either or both of those roles.
