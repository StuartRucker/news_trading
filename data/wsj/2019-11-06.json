Still, it is routinely assumed that America is a dynamic, wealth-creating powerhouse compared with its sluggish European rivals, burdened as they are by statist oversight and intervention. What few realize, Mr. Philippon says, is that Europe is fast becoming a haven for free-market competition; it's the U.S. that has become mired in an anti-competitive, quasi-monopolistic environment where companies that are \"too big to fail\" wield influence to crowd out newcomers and drive prices up while pushing investment and productivity down.", "categories": [["Books & Arts", "Books", "Bookshelf"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts/books?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/bookshelf?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/city-liberals-country-sitting-ducks-11573084177", "title": "City Liberals, Country Sitting Ducks", "date": "2019-11-06 18:49", "summary": "Farmers in a poor upstate county look ahead to a grim future under New York's foie gras ban..

Andy Kessler's excellent \"Follow Michael Crichton's Rule\" (Inside View, Nov. 4) on the dumbing down of \"science, the data and the studies\" brings to mind the great Nobel physicist Richard Feynman's 1974 Caltech commencement address entitled \"Cargo Cult Science.\" Feynman's instructive words to the students (many of them future scientists) echoes strongly today: \"For example, if you're doing an experiment, you should report everything that you think might make it invalid-not only what you think is right about it: other causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you thought of that you've eliminated by some other experiment, and how they worked-to make sure the other fellow can tell they've been eliminated. Details that could throw doubt on your interpretation must be given, if you know them. You must do the best you can-if you know anything at all wrong, or possibly wrong-to explain it. . . . In summary, the idea is to give all of the information to help others to judge the value of your contribution [theory]; not just the information that leads to judgment in one particular direction or another.\"", "categories": [["Opinion", "Letters"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/opinion?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/letters?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rep-katie-hill-should-take-responsibility-for-her-acts-11573074595", "title": "Rep.
