By now I've planted more than 7,000 at Gresgarth Hall [in Lancashire, England]. The Pinus lambertiana pine cone in the middle of the table is native to Oregon and California; it's indicative of my passion for growing trees from seed. The painting of an enlarged nigella seed above was done by Brigid Edwards, who I think, along with Rory McEwen, is one of the greatest botanical painters ever. The Piranesi print of the Teatro di Marcello [in Rome], which is an original from the 1700s, shows where I was brought up. I lived right up at the top with a view of the Temple of Vesta. When you go to Rome in April, there are these lovely azaleas indica, which you can see here in the pot on the floor. On the left side of the table is a collection of books by Vita Sackville-West. When I originally came over to England around 1967, the first garden I saw was hers. I always liked the way she wrote about plants, as if they were friends. Below is a Rotring A3 drawing board, which has a master plan of a garden I did for Trudie [Styler] and Sting. It's my favorite because it's light and I can carry it with me. My husband, Mark, designed the grabber in front. He copied it from one owned by the great gardener Princess Greta Sturdza. She had this amazing garden in Normandy. Both my daughters are artists. One of them, Dominique Lacloche, made the bronze sculpture of a gunnera leaf, in the center of the table, as a Christmas present for me. My other daughter, Patricia L. Boyd, works with sculpture and video. The Showa gloves to the right are the only ones I can garden in. They're very light and easy to wear. On top are Felco secateurs. The wonderful thing is if your blade goes blunt you can send them back and they put a new one in for you. The Uzbek cushion on the lower right is one of my favorites. I like the landscapes of these very wild countries that also have these wonderful materials, patterns and artifacts. I bought the Chinese lantern either in Kunming or Beijing 16 years ago. It's made of very fine metal with this lovely pattern, and inside there's a type of gauze, so the light of a candle is gentle. I fell in love with the beauty of the country and the energy of the people in it. I traveled to China four times after that.
