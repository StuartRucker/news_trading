The collection was made of 33 ready-to-wear looks and 10 couture looks focused on sleek, body-conscious silhouettes including a long corseted, strapless dress in black leather. Jean Paul Gaultier was also looking for a new perspective this season and handed over the atelier keys to Chitose Abe, who is also the creative director of Sacai. Abe made her first foray into haute couture as a guest designer for this season only. The collection was a combination of Gaultier's signature looks mixed with Abe's playful aesthetic, demonstrated through pieces like reconstructed pinstripe tailoring and tattoo prints. Later in the week, designer Demna Gvasalia unveiled the first haute couture collection for Balenciaga since its founder Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga closed the atelier 53 years ago. The revival included all-black tailoring, expansive taffeta silhouettes, intricate embroideries and striking denim ensembles. Elsewhere, there were brightly colored tweeds and delicate cropped tops at Chanel, and oversize jewel-embellished gowns at Viktor & Rolf.
