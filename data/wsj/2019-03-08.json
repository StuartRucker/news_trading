Plus: The unmistakable hotness of hats. ONE MINUTE CAN feel incredibly long. The 60 seconds of silence commemorating the recently deceased designer Karl Lagerfeld at his final Chanel show in Paris this week vibrated with an acute awareness of his legacy: 36 years at the French brand (and 54 years at Fendi, plus an eponymous line, photographs, furniture, books). For that minute, editors, buyers, photographers and celebrities muted the collegial chatter that fills in-between moments during the month of fashion shows. Then, after the sound system broadcast a snippet of Mr. Lagerfeld's voice, his beloved efficiency prevailed. Chimes sounded and the show began: 72 elegant apr\u00e8s-ski looks marched across a wintry set of snowy chalets.

There havebeen many attempts to tell the story of the Roman Empire from the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 B.C. to the death of Constantine in A.D. 337, but they generally suffer from the fact that many of the more than 50 emperors during that period were fairly nondescript. Barry Strauss, a classics professor at Cornell University and the author of several books on the ancient world, has hit upon a way around the problem, taking his cue from Suetonius, whose \"Twelve Caesars,\" though a great work, was written fairly early in the empire's history and thus lacked the full range of leaders from which to choose. Mr. Strauss concentrates on the lives of the 10 most significant emperors all told, and the result is an exceptionally accessible history of the Roman Empire.", "categories": [["Books & Arts", "Books", "Bookshelf"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts/books?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/bookshelf?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/matchmakers-emerge-as-an-antidote-to-the-agony-of-online-dating-11552059390", "title": "Matchmakers Emerge as an Antidote to the Agony of Online Dating", "date": "2019-03-08 10:36", "summary": "'We're both here because we've waved the white flag'.

Half, if not 100%, of all housing is affordable depending on how you spin it. (If it sold or rented it's affordable). The 1967 University of Michigan study \"New Homes and Poor People\" demonstrated when 1,000 new homes are built, 3,545 moves take place in a chain of moves. People move into the new 1,000 units at a rent of, say, $2,000 a month, vacating $1,500-a-month units which are then occupied by people vacating $900-a-month dwellings, etc., until no vacant units were left behind in the chain. There were an average of 3.5 moves for every new home. Of the 3,545 households that moved, 1,290 were categorized as low- and moderate-income at the time by the government.
