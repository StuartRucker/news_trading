In the United States in 2002, Rosalind Wiseman published \"Queen Bees & Wannabes,\" a self-help book for girls navigating high-school factions.

What Mr. Doescher in his prologue slyly calls a \"fey story\" recasts each scene of the film as it might have been staged at the Globe Theatre, with pratfalls, murmured asides, and entrances and exeunts galore. As devotees of \"Mean Girls\" can tell you, the story follows 16-year-old Cady Heron, hitherto homeschooled by her zoologist parents in Africa, as she enters the bewildering hierarchies of junior year at North Shore High in Evanston, Ill.
