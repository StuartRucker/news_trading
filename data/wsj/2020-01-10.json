Nancy Mitford was the eldest of six sisters, the daughters of Lord Redesdale, an impecunious Oxfordshire-based aristocrat known as \"Farve\" to his children. The girls' unorthodox childhood was enlivened by jokes, or \"teases\" in the Mitford idiom; batty household economies (when their mother decided to do away with napkins at meals to save money, the headline in the local press was \"Peeress Saves Ha'Pence\") and idiosyncratic variations on country sports (such as the family \"child hunt,\" during which Farve chased his children across the countryside with bloodhounds).

At first he worked to the brink of death in the Arctic gold and coal mines of Kolyma; later he survived in marginally more bearable conditions as a camp paramedic. Released in 1951, he began to write of the experience, ultimately producing (along with a great deal of poetry) six books of first-person, autobiographical short stories. Some of these stories were smuggled out of the U.S.S.R. and published in piecemeal fashion during Shalamov's lifetime, but it is only with the arrival of Donald Rayfield's translation in two fat volumes titled \"Kolyma Stories\" (New York Review Books, 741 pages, $22.95) and \"Sketches of the Criminal World: Further Kolyma Stories\" (NYRB, 555 pages, $22.95) that the collections-so remarkable for both their historical witness and their literary integrity-have become fully available to readers of English.", "categories": [["Books & Arts", "Books", "Bookshelf"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts/books?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/bookshelf?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/me-and-rocket-man-review-a-pop-star-of-our-time-11578671267", "title": "'Me' and 'Rocket Man' Review: A Pop Star of Our Time", "date": "2020-01-10 10:47", "summary": "Elton John is a reverse Zelig who turns up everywhere, going out of his way to be as conspicuous as possible..
