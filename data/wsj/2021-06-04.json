The Oxford English Dictionary tells me that the word \"witch\" entered the English language in the year 890, designating \"a man who practices witchcraft or magic; a magician, sorcerer, wizard.\" It only took a century for the word to migrate over gender lines and settle elsewhere for good, becoming \"a woman supposed to have dealings with the devil or evil spirits and to be able by their co-operation to perform supernatural acts.\" I don't think I need to say much about the cultural and political implications suggested by that transition. There are countless fictions centered on the idea of women whose evil originates in their dreadful power (Circe on her island, turning men to pigs), or on the horrifying conceit that some women might have power at all (the three witches who foretell Macbeth's doom). Most contemporary witch-driven narratives (a boggling count, Amazon assures) are romances with tinges of terror (the witch made lonely by power now looking for love) but there are also the more substantial, entertaining revisionist witches (J.K. Rowling's Hermione; Madeline Miller's take on Circe; Marvel's Wanda Maximov). High-art witch stories have tended to fare less well, the metaphorical potential of the material turning art into a civics class. Arthur Miller's play \"The Crucible\" is the worst of these, so clearly an allegory for Wrongful Persecution by the Powerful.
