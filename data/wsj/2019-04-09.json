WE ARRIVED IN BERLIN in the summer of 2013. It wasn't my first time in the city-I had been to a literature festival a few years earlier, and before that I went for research, each visit just a couple of days. I felt that I could never get used to the wide, cold and empty streets, and the people who always seemed to have a frown on their faces. I grew up in Nigeria, a former British colony, and many of my encounters with Germans were in spy novels and thrillers, by British and American authors, where Germans tended to be the villains. A lot of that perception still lingered in my psyche. When I told my wife I'd been offered a writing fellowship and we'd be spending a year in Berlin, her response was: \"One year in Berlin, doing what?\" It was a big gamble, uprooting our three young kids from Virginia where we'd lived for six years, and moving them to a country where we didn't speak the language or had any relations or friends.", "categories": [["Life & Work", "Travel", "Off Duty Travel"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/life-work?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/magazine/travel?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/off-duty-travel?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-rich-kazakhstan-calls-snap-election-as-political-transition-gathers-pace-11554798948", "title": "Oil-Rich Kazakhstan Calls Snap Election", "date": "2019-04-09 12:32", "summary": "Vote will be the first since autocrat Nursultan Nazarbayev said he was stepping down.
