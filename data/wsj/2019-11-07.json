During the Vietnam War I volunteered to be a combat infantry officer. Then I was transferred into the Navy, where I remained for 30 years, primarily in naval intelligence, doing highly classified missions. Most people think of me as the guy who found the Titanic [in 1985]. That was a cover for a military operation, which was recently declassified. I was actually exploring two nuclear submarines we lost in the area. The caps are sitting on a model of Alvin, a deep-diving submarine that I landed on the Titanic, before sending a robot down inside. Behind it is an oil painting of the Titanic. On the lower shelf is a black smoker chimney, which we discovered in the Pacific in 1979. They belch out a fluid that's hot enough to melt lead. That helped us explain the chemistry of the world's oceans. The cap and hood on either side of the black smoker signify my academic life-I have 22 honorary doctorates in addition to my Ph.D.-and leaning against it is the Hubbard Medal presented to me by the National Geographic Society. Hanging on the mantel are two more medals, from the Explorers Club. In the corner, that's a tube worm in the glass container. In 1977, we discovered a complex ecosystem of exotic creatures that had figured out, over eons, how to duplicate photosynthesis in the darkness of the ocean. This discovery helps explain the origin of life on earth-and points to the high probability of it existing on other planets, even within our own solar system. The framed photo on top is of two of my children-Todd, on the right, died in a car accident when he was 20. Next to it is a cartoon I published in National Geographic in 1981 that said, We're no longer going to send our bodies to the bottom of the ocean; we are going to use telepresence, with advanced robotics.
