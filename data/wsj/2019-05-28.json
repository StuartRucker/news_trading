I see true beauty in sacrifice. I see something essential and elemental. You need to be humbled; you need to be reminded of your role in the lives of others. I've loved art by a lot of people that have been empirically awful, and for a long time, I struggled with the dissonance between an artist's beautiful vision of the world and the selling of a horrible lifestyle as a justification for it. The problem is how often the artist gets emulated rather than the art. The lifestyle becomes a product.

WSJ. tails her for the day. IF I HAD REALIZED how difficult it would be, I might not have done it,\" Regina Hall says of acting. Although Hall, 48, has worked consistently for more than two decades, it's her midcareer roles that have garnered her a new level of recognition. First came the surprise 2017 box office hit Girls Trip, co-starring Queen Latifah, Tiffany Haddish and Jada Pinkett Smith. Shortly after, Hall played the lead in the critically acclaimed independent film Support the Girls, a feel-good comedy about a compassionate bar manager. The one-two punch coincided with the mainstreaming of black Hollywood. For much of her career, Hall appeared in projects that proved popular (and profitable) with black audiences, including classics like Love & Basketball and The Best Man. But recently films with majority-African American casts, like Get Out and Black Panther, have been shattering box office records. As a result, the stars of such bold dramas and comedies are being tapped for even more big-budget studio projects. This month, for instance, Hall plays alongside Samuel L. Jackson in Shaft, director Tim Story's sequel to the 1971 hit blaxploitation film by the same name. (Hall had previously appeared in Story's 2012 Think Like a Man.) \"It's wonderful to see people [you've worked with] get different opportunities,\" Hall says. \"Box office really dictates what you're able to do next.\"", "categories": [["Tracked"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/types/magazine-tracked?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-fiat-chrysler-pursues-renault-tie-up-nissan-weighs-stakes-11559045529", "title": "As Fiat Chrysler Pursues Renault Tie-Up, Nissan Weighs Stakes", "date": "2019-05-28 08:12", "summary": "Proposed deal carries risks-and potential benefits-for Renault partner Nissan.
