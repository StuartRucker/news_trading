Ms. Epperly Sulek points to compression as the culprit-a combination of pent-up demand and less inventory since most travelers are still staying stateside. \"We're seeing sky-high prices in Hawaii and California and a feeding frenzy in Florida.\" For the best-bang-for-your-seaside-buck, she recommends looking just beyond the U.S.: Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Jamaica, for example. Not only are they good values, she said, they're easy to access. \"Travel protocols to get into many countries change by the hour,\" she said, \"but those places have been open for a while so they don't need to ramp up the runway.\" Determined to stay in the U.S.? Bargain-hunters would be wise to look at less conventional beach destinations. \"Northern Michigan is so stunningly beautiful and most people don't give it a second thought,\" said Jill Taylor, a travel adviser at Chicago-based Jet Set World Travel. \"All the way up the coast of Lake Michigan-northern Wisconsin too-is gorgeous.
