By all accounts Sergio Vieira de Mello was a brilliantly accomplished diplomat and a dedicated international servant specializing in conflict resolution. \"Sergio,\" a Netflix docudrama directed by Greg Barker from a banal screenplay by Craig Borten, catches flashes of his brilliance from time to time but scatters and dims them through a mosaic structure that's ultimately no structure at all. The film, which stars Wagner Moura in the title role, lacks a dramatic center. Instead, it has a central event. The story plays out mostly in flashbacks while Sergio, the Brazilian-born United Nations envoy to war-ravaged Iraq, lies dying in the rubble of the U.N. headquarters in Baghdad that fell to a 2003 terrorist bombing.", "categories": [["Books & Arts", "Film Review"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/film-review?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/defending-jacob-review-the-anguish-of-suspicion-11587069654", "title": "'Defending Jacob' Review: The Anguish of Suspicion", "date": "2020-04-16 16:40", "summary": "The parents of a teenage boy suspected of murdering a classmate struggle to believe in their child's innocence..

There have been plenty of identical-twin films since Hollywood's Golden Age, but none as fitting for Davis, master of the genre, as this one would have been-a horror tale about a sanitarium in which a woman is mistakenly imprisoned, thanks to the machinations of her twin sister.

We learn, quickly, that Siri-whose behavior had caused her to be confined in this resort-like facility in Sweden, supposedly dedicated to the treatment of psychopaths-had devised a perfect scheme to get out. Having successfully induced Helena to come and visit, she proceeds with a plan to steal her sister's identity and make her escape.", "categories": [["Books & Arts", "Television Review"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/television-review?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-dolls-house-part-2-review-small-screen-small-stage-big-impact-11587069156", "title": "'A Doll's House, Part 2' Review: Small Screen, Small Stage, Big Impact", "date": "2020-04-16 16:32", "summary": "Florida Repertory Theatre's production of Lucas Hnath's play rises where the original Broadway production stumbled..

Kathryn Bradley-Hole, the illustrated British weekly's garden editor for 18 years, has chosen 62 garden profiles from the nearly 900 she wrote during her tenure. Her selection-featuring gardens and country houses large and small, from the ancient to the lately established-is divided into 17 thematic sections, from topiary, formal and cottage gardens to decidedly postmodern gardens designed to \"succeed in an environmentally challenging world.\" The concise profiles are accompanied by full-color images by many of today's outstanding English landscape photographers, and some also by fascinating archival materials. Section headers and picture captions provide historical context, addressing the impact on gardens of changing styles, design, economics and technology. In the 1700s, for example, when the land changed hands from the aristocracy to the new industrial and mercantile rich, many formal gardens were swept away in favor of private parks and a more naturalistic landscape aesthetic. These new landscapes were far from natural, since to create private parks, land was grabbed from neighbors, streams were diverted, and greenswards were cleared and manicured by a full-time staff. In the 1800s, global trade-and that great engineering innovation, the glasshouse-allowed the introduction of tender plants from around the world, while the invention of the cylinder mower encouraged greater use of lawns without the labor previously required to cut grass with scythes.
