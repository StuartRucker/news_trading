Instead, it's a purpose that I follow and a value that I cherish, whether it's in human relationships or acting. Acting is always very simple for me. Maybe it's because I have such an appetite for it. I guess for somebody else it could be difficult. Of course, that doesn't mean the roles are simple; and you don't arrive at that simplicity without a lot of conditions. You have to pull a thread between yourself and the final delivery of your performance. Even in the relationship with the director, I like simplicity.
