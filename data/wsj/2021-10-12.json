Now Warner Classics is reminding us of his importance with an edition of 55 CDs titled \"The Complete Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler on Record\"-the bulk of its bounty from the EMI archives, with contributions from Polydor, Telefunken, English Decca and Deutsche Grammophon.", "categories": [["Books & Arts", "Music Review"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/music-review?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/alisal-fire-prompts-evacuations-freeway-closure-in-santa-barbara-county-11634058078", "title": "Alisal Fire Prompts Evacuations, Freeway Closure in Santa Barbara County", "date": "2021-10-12 16:57", "summary": "Southern California blaze has scorched thousands of acres since sparking Monday.
