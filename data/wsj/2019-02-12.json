Your Feb. 4 editorial \"Steel Tariff Profiteers\" cherry picks data and ignores key facts. For one, you use the February-November time frame to calculate the increase in employment, even though the tariffs were not fully implemented until later. You cite a loss of 100 jobs in the steel industry during that period, but if you instead cite the March-November time frame, there is instead an increase of 1,000 jobs according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.", "categories": [["Opinion", "Letters"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/opinion?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/letters?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/book-value-isnt-everything-in-selecting-a-value-fund-11550003023", "title": "Book Value Isn't Everything In Selecting a Value Fund", "date": "2019-02-12 15:23", "summary": "The assets' value depends on their ability to generate future cash, not on what somebody once paid for them.. I always enjoy Mark Hulbert's investing columns and \"Want to Invest in a True 'Value' Fund? Good Luck\" (Journal Report, Feb. 4) is no exception. But I do think investors must be cautious about using book value as a benchmark. With most companies it's based on relatively ancient transactions that often undervalue the company's assets (though they can overvalue them for companies in dying businesses). Microsoft, for instance, trades at over 10 times its book value. The assets' value depends on their ability to generate future cash, not on what somebody once paid for them. The major exception is financial companies, most of whose assets are frequently revalued to reflect current market conditions.
