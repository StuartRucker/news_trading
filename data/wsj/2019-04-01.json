We're city folk; we go and pretend to ranch. Everything is like an accident waiting to happen when we're up there. My friend Jimmi Simpson gave me the framed picture of the monkeys in the back. A few years ago, he and I did a play called Trevor, which was about a woman who lives with a chimpanzee. He played the chimp. He gave me that picture on closing night.

Every time I walk past it, I have to get within three inches of it to make sure it's not a photograph-it's that realistic. The photo in front is of my four kids. About 10 years ago, my eldest daughter, Zoe Perry, took the other three kids down to Sears. Zoe knew how funny it would be to have their picture taken. It's always in whatever dressing room I'm sitting in. My older son made the 'Tony Award' for me when I was nominated for a play called The Other Place. I lost. He was in Idaho watching and made the award using a wood-burning kit. I bought the shell to the left at the Rose Bowl Flea Market in Pasadena about 10 years ago. I find it mesmerizing.

Sometimes I like to go back and see what notes I've made in the margins. For my new play, Hillary and Clinton, my script is in the form of a big old manuscript in a three-ring binder. The booklets are representative of all the theater I've done over the years. It's my favorite way to work. Finally, the multicolored card was something my other son gave me.
