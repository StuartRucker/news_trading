In 1912 Albania had declared its independence, after suffering five centuries of Ottoman domination, only a few years before the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. But in the post-World War I vacuum that existed in southern Europe, regional powers circled little Albania like vultures. Greek military units marauded through southern Albania committing horrific acts of ethnic cleansing and genocide, while to the north Serbs were perpetrating other pogroms against Albanians. Situated in a dangerous neighborhood with coveted access to the Adriatic, Albania had few friends and many enemies. The one friend standing between Albania and the vultures was Woodrow Wilson. If not for his intercession at the Paris Peace Conference, Albania wouldn't exist as a country. Today, President Wilson is revered by Albanians and is a key reason why Albania is one of the most pro-American countries in the world.

Add the savings in cancer treatment if you were only needing to treat early versus advanced cancers and the cost effectiveness is clear. There will be bumps along the road, like picking up breast cancers too early to visualize on mammogram or MRI, but this may also lead to treatments that don't involve invasive procedures.
