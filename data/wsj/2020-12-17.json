In his memoir \"Magic Time,\" Mr. Wilson, now 93, writes fondly of how these and other electrifying moments of New York playgoing led him, circuitously, to Yale Drama School and a lifetime of teaching and making theater happen-writing scripts, directing and producing plays, encouraging young talent, and writing or cowriting three of the most enduring college theater textbooks. At the heart of the book, however, is an account of his long tenure as The Wall Street Journal's theater critic, from 1972 to 1994. It was work that, with its first-night tickets and aisle seats, returned him to what drew him to the dramatic arts in the first place-an audience member's experience of living theater.
