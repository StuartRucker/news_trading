Unfortunately, the historic record of such guarantees by the U.S. is spotty at best. For example, in the aftermath of the 1956 Sinai Campaign which was triggered in part by Egypt President Gamal Abdel Nasser's blockade of the Straits of Tiran to Israel-bound ships, President Eisenhower issued an aide-m\u00e9moire (a form of guarantee) to Israel that included the following: \"No nation has the right to prevent free and innocent passage . . . through the Straits [of Tiran] . . . the United States . . . is prepared to exercise the right of free and innocent passage and to join with others to secure general recognition of this right.\" When Nasser again closed the Straits of Tiran to Israel-bound ships on May 22, 1967, Israel appealed to President Lyndon Johnson to invoke the U.S. guarantee.
