Giuseppe Tomasi, Prince of Lampedusa and Duke of Palma, had two more titles than anyone needs, and, for the first 58 years of his life, too much time-numbingly vast stretches of largely undistinguished, unencumbered years in a Sicily that was always, in his words, \"hankering for voluptuous immobility.\" When some lock in him finally turned around 1955, he began work on one of the most magisterial and delicate works of 20th-century fiction, racing to complete and publish it before death overtook him in 1957. (He died at age 60 three weeks after his manuscript was rejected for the second time by a publisher.) Published at last a year after his death, \"The Leopard,\" about the rise of republicanism and the end of feudalism in Sicily in the 1860s, is politically ambiguous, written from the perspective of the Sicilian nobles but also revealing their (sometimes) lovable uselessness. Some early critics met \"The Leopard\" with condescending stupefaction: Who was this Sicilian parvenu, whose death conveniently prevented his being made to account for himself? But the later emergence of Tomasi di Lampedusa's letters, stories and essays revealed a mind that had been churning continuously, devouring the literature and vernacular of half a dozen languages and dessicating his singular wit to a dryness extreme even by the standards of his half-desert home of Palermo.", "categories": [["Books & Arts", "Books", "Bookshelf"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts/books?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/bookshelf?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/store-bought-solutions-to-all-our-ills-11572016104", "title": "Fiction: Store-Bought Solutions to All Our Ills", "date": "2019-10-25 11:08", "summary": "A corporate thriller about a certain mammoth e-tailer with plans for world domi-nation..
