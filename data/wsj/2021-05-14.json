On March 9, 1916, Doroteo Arango, known to history as Francisco \"Pancho\" Villa, attacked the ramshackle border town of Columbus, N.M., to provoke an American invasion of Mexico that he believed would restore his flagging fortunes as a Mexican revolutionary. President Woodrow Wilson obliged him. He authorized Brig. Gen. John J. \"Black Jack\" Pershing to conduct an expedition into Chihuahua, Mexico, to slay or seize Villa and destroy his rebel force. During the ensuing 11 months of hot, dusty marches, Pershing failed to kill, capture or even spot Pancho Villa. The U.S. Army, however, fought several desultory skirmishes with Villa's men and learned valuable lessons in organization, tactics and logistics that would prove highly useful when it entered World War I the following year. The \"Punitive Expedition\" also failed to revive Villa's reputation, and he spun slowly into irrelevance amid the swirling waters of Revolutionary Mexico.", "categories": [["Books & Arts", "Books", "Bookshelf"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts/books?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/bookshelf?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-will-attempt-to-land-rover-on-mars-in-coming-days-11620999668", "title": "China Will Attempt to Land Rover on Mars in Coming Days", "date": "2021-05-14 09:41", "summary": "National space agency plans for rover to explore the planet for about three months, marking a milestone in China's ambitious space program if successful.
