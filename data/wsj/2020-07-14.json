The idea that I would want her to know about my research while at the same time disowning that research when she approvingly wrote of it is nonsensical. Second, Ms. Mac Donald knew the reason for the retraction wasn't her support of the work because I sent her an email clearly stating this point before she published her op-ed. Third, I have not retracted my other work on police shootings, which has also been controversial. An earlier 2019 paper of mine, which found no evidence of anti-black disparities in the likelihood of being fatally shot when controlling for crime rates, also resulted in calls for retraction and positive endorsement by prominent conservative voices, but I continue to uphold that work.
