Three bars offer ways to freshen up this old-school tipple. The French 75 is a quintessential champagne cocktail, a fizzy mix of bubbly, gin, lemon juice and sugar. But an early, lesser-known recipe for the concoction employs another French import instead of the gin: cognac, the grape-based brandy that was once among the most ubiquitous spirits in mixed drinks. By the early 1900s, when the French 75 was introduced, cognac wasn't so common, partially due to the mid-1800s phylloxera epidemic, which had diminished production. Yet Chris Hannah, co-owner of the New Orleans bar Jewel of the South, believes that cognac was actually the French 75's original base spirit. Hannah makes his French 75s with Charles de Cazanove Brut Champagne and D'Uss\u00e9 VSOP, which he finds better complements the flavors of lemon and sugar than gin does. Cognac is now in the throes of a renaissance, and many old brandy-based recipes for drinks like the Sazerac and the mint julep are being resurrected.

Flor's dinner offerings include lamb ribs with yogurt and black lime, paired primarily with sustainably produced European wines. Designed by James Beard Award-winning firm The MP Shift, Flor's interiors boast original double-height Crittall Victorian windows.
