Research, experience and common sense tell us otherwise. The mind is more than the sum of its neuronal connections. It links us to external reality while at the same time creating our sense of who we are-what makes us different from everyone else. It has both objective (material) and subjective (immaterial) aspects. It understands the third law of thermodynamics but also recalls the cool breeze on a late summer's afternoon. While the mind no doubt operates inside the brain, it extends well beyond-in time and space-constantly engaging with the brains of other people, the surrounding environment and the larger culture.
