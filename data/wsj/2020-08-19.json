It's still hallowed ground for surfers, even if they drive nicer cars now.. The Malibu Wall dates back to 1929. It was erected on a coastal strip just north of Los Angeles as part of the perimeter of the Adamson House. The estate-built for the daughter of Malibu's last owner, back when the entire area was a ranch-made liberal use of Spanish Revival design details, right down to the red tile and turrets that topped its sea-facing gray brick wall. By the summer of 1957, when 16-year-old Kathy Kohner, nicknamed Gidget, began dragging her surfboard across Malibu's Surfrider Beach, and leaning it against that very wall, the beach had become a magnet for the nascent surfer crowd. They came to ride First Point, just off shore, one of the world's best breaks. Gidget was the rare surfer girl back then. She kept a diary of her sunny summer antics and shared entries with her father, screenwriter Frederick Kohner, a Czech Jew \u00e9migr\u00e9. In just six weeks, Frederick penned the book \"Gidget: The Little Girl with Big Ideas.\" Soon came Gidget movies and a TV series, the beach-party film genre, surf music and a national surf craze.", "categories": [["Life & Work", "Travel", "Off Duty Travel"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/life-work?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/magazine/travel?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/off-duty-travel?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/colleges-scramble-to-contain-coronavirus-as-they-open-campuses-11597850914", "title": "Colleges Scramble to Contain Coronavirus as They Open Campuses", "date": "2020-08-19 11:28", "summary": "The University of Notre Dame and Michigan State University are the latest schools to change plans.
