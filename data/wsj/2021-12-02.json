Wade Made Viability the Key to Abortion Law", "date": "2021-12-02 10:55", "summary": "A half-century ago, science and legal precedent led the Supreme Court to make fetal viability the standard in abortion law. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, a case centering on a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks except \"in medical emergencies or for severe fetal abnormality.\" The case raises a crucial question: Can states ban abortion before the point, at roughly 23 weeks, when the fetus is \"viable\"-that is, able to survive outside the pregnant woman's body? If the court answers yes, it could overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion until viability.", "categories": [["Life & Work", "Ideas", "Essay"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/life-work?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/life-work/ideas?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/essay?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pandas-face-rival-for-animal-kingdoms-goodwill-ambassador-pangolins-11638459916", "title": "Pandas Face New Rival for Goodwill Ambassador: Pangolins", "date": "2021-12-02 10:45", "summary": "Resume Subscription.
