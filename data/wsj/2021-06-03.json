This summer, at the Manhattan flagship of Morgenstern's Finest Ice Cream, founder and owner Nicholas Morgenstern and architect Stephanie Goto are reinventing the idea of the classic sundae bar, with inspiration from Dom P\u00e9rignon's chef de cave, Vincent Chaperon. Goto, who has spent much of her career creating spaces for chefs and restaurants, as well as designing exhibitions for art galleries like Pace and Hauser & Wirth, is developing a special omakase-style tasting menu that will combine Japanese flavors, ice cream and Dom P\u00e9rignon vintage champagnes. \"It dawned on me that something quintessentially American and quintessentially French could collide and tell a story about the essence of each,\" Goto says, adding that her own Japanese heritage influenced the menu's ingredients, like uni, wasabi and shiso. The parlor takeover was scheduled to open last spring as a reservations-only tasting table. After a year of delays and isolation, however, Goto wanted to expand the project to reach passersby with sundaes, available to go, inspired by the champagne pairings and, eventually, ice cream bars to be sold nationwide. \"We are breaking down the wall of the parlor and letting the whole experience spill out to the world and welcoming everybody back,\" Goto says. \"It's about pulling and teasing your senses to come alive again.\" morgensternsnyc.com", "categories": [["What's News"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/types/magazine-what-s-news?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/meme-stocks-gyrate-after-amc-files-to-sell-more-shares-11622721750", "title": "AMC Shares Sink on Stock Sale Plan, Warning to Buyers", "date": "2021-06-03 19:28", "summary": "Investors begin to backpedal as movie-theater operator cautions potential purchasers of its shares that they might lose money.

Then it settles down, regroups with aplomb and moves to a courtroom where an intriguing, based-on-a-true-story trial is about to begin-the defendant in a particularly grisly murder case pleading not guilty by reason of demonic possession. That's good, and the sequence gets even better when the jury greets the announcement with silence and straight faces. But it's the last we see of the trial.
