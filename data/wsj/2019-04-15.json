Robert Poole's \"If You Drive, You Should Pay\" (op-ed, April 9) calls \"customer-friendly\" tolling the answer to our nation's interstate problems. Oh, the irony. Tolls aren't an option for most roads, as private operators are primarily only interested in high-traffic interstates in urban areas where they can turn a profit. But what happens to state highways and major secondary roads? These roads will be used even more as drivers go around tolls. Local municipalities are stuck footing the bill for additional wear and tear on secondary roads. Increased traffic volume on these roads will also lead to more congestion and accidents.", "categories": [["Opinion", "Letters"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/opinion?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/letters?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/not-all-financial-planning-is-created-equal-11555360305", "title": "Not All Financial Planning Is Created Equal", "date": "2019-04-15 16:31", "summary": "The Better Way to Pay for Financial Advice\" (Exchange, April 6) doesn't place enough emphasis on the human component of investing..
