Finding light and the radiance of knowledge in a period we have, ever since the Renaissance poet and scholar Petrarch inaugurated the phrase, belittled as \"the Dark Ages\" is not a new effort. But unlike, for example, James Hannam, whose \"God's Philosophers\" (2009) sought to reestablish the Church as the chief sponsor of scientific innovation, Mr. Falk, a lecturer in medieval history at Cambridge University, is not given to grand pronouncements. Instead, \"The Light Ages\" is a prodigiously detailed ode to the medieval (and, it turns out, very modern) impulse \"to tinker, to redesign, to incrementally improve or upgrade technology.\" By the end of Mr. Falk's book, even previously indifferent readers will, I promise, never want to use \"medieval\" as a slur word again.", "categories": [["Books & Arts", "Books", "Bookshelf"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts/books?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/bookshelf?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/leonard-cohen-review-everybody-knows-him-11605892144", "title": "'Leonard Cohen' Review: Everybody Knows Him", "date": "2020-11-20 12:09", "summary": "Magnetic from the start, it wasn't at first clear he would make his mark in song..
