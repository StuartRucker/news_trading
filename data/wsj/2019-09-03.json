For the 2020 election, the big question is: Can the decoupling of the U.S. economy from China take place without tanking the U.S. economy? It's not impossible. After all, other low-wage countries are eager to take over China's role and keep the products flowing (no, those jobs won't be coming to the U.S.). Apple may have a big adjustment to make but also has big profit margins to absorb the cost. China still wants American technology. Boeing jetliners won't be easily replaced. If China buys Brazilian soybeans, Brazil's existing customers will have to buy soybeans elsewhere.
