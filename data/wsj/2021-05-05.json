Plus: an 'intensely embarrassing' reality dating show.. JAPAN'S THRUMMING capital-with more than 37 million people in the greater metropolitan area-was devastatingly quiet much of last year. The neon-bright wards of Shibuya and Shinjuku dimmed for months when the thousands of tiny shops and giant department stores temporarily closed or slashed their hours. Throughout the city, parishioners carrying portable shrines stopped dancing shoulder-to-shoulder in the streets. A favorite late-night snack-ice-cold beers with a side of fried chicken-was mostly consumed at home. Now, amid the vaccine rollout, Tokyo has been busily preparing to host the postponed Olympics starting July 23. Yet officials implemented the third citywide lockdown in late April in an effort to contain infection from new Covid-19 variants, and the country's borders remain closed to foreign visitors, with a reopening date still uncertain. In June, authorities will announce whether locals can attend the games in person. The only upside: Frustrated travelers might count themselves lucky to avoid a sweltering summer in Tokyo. No handkerchief is large enough to soak up sweat from humidity that descends from the Pacific Ocean's southerly winds. Yet the city's steamy season does have its virtues: countless outdoor festivals, humongous hydrangeas in the parks, nighttime visits to temples adorned with lanterns, the soundtrack of jazz bands on the streets, even the cicadas perform day and night. Thanks to a few clued-in residents, we've come up with myriad ways to approximate summer in the multifarious metropolis, while watching the Olympics in air-conditioned comfort.", "categories": [["Life & Work", "Travel", "Off Duty Travel"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/life-work?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/magazine/travel?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/off-duty-travel?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/resilient-services-sector-points-to-global-economic-pickup-despite-covid-19-flare-ups-11620205294", "title": "Resilient Services Sector Points to Global Economic Pickup", "date": "2021-05-05 11:28", "summary": "Activity in India's services sector continued to grow in April despite record infections; businesses in U.S. report additional gains.
