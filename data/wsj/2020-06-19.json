In 'The Land of Counterpane,\" Robert Louis Stevenson recalls the feeling of total imaginative transport in childhood. A sick child confined to bed, with toy soldiers as companions, becomes \"the giant great and still / that sits upon the pillow hill\" surveying the battlefields of his fancy. The intensity of such early moments helps form what Wordsworth called \"the master-light of all our seeing.\" For most of us, childhood turns into memory. For writers and artists who create works for children, it often becomes a wellspring of creativity. That was true for C.S. Lewis, who spent long hours of his Northern Irish boyhood reading myths and legends and, with his brother, making up adventures about talking animals in an imaginary realm.", "categories": [["Books & Arts", "Books", "Bookshelf"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts/books?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/bookshelf?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/death-in-her-hands-review-what-became-of-magda-11592578560", "title": "'Death in Her Hands' Review: What Became of Magda?", "date": "2020-06-19 10:56", "summary": "A literary novel with all the trappings of a thriller about the power of imagination to console and warp.. It has been a year since Vesta Gul moved across the country to Levant, a poor backwater in what could pass for upstate New York. She skedaddled with her new puppy soon after the funeral of her husband of nearly 40 years, eager to trade their posh-but-dull West Coast house for what promised to be a \"dream home\": a rustic cabin on a lake. Her first seasons in her new digs passed peacefully enough, particularly the \"dreamland\" of winter with its gray, vanishing days inviting a kind of cozy hibernation. But the spring thaw meant earlier dawns, later dusks and an agitating sense that there was so much more time to be up and alive. Unfortunately, Vesta threw away her nerves-soothing Lorazepam when her husband died and is too embarrassed to ask a local to prescribe more. She is therefore already on edge when she spots, on her morning walk, a handwritten note about a fresh murder. \"Her name was Magda,\" it reads. \"Nobody will ever know who killed her. It wasn't me. Here is her dead body.\" Yet there is no body to be found.", "categories": [["Books & Arts", "Books", "Bookshelf"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts/books?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/bookshelf?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-inner-coast-review-freshwater-freak-11592578507", "title": "'The Inner Coast' Review: Freshwater Freak", "date": "2020-06-19 10:55", "summary": "Non\ufb01ction narratives of America's interior waterways by a writer combing the shoreline of science and literature..
