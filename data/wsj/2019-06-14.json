Regarding your editorial \"Biden Flips Over Abortion Funding\" (June 8): If Joe Biden, or any Democrat, wants to become president in 2020, he or she must capture the votes of the independents and the \"anyone but Trump\" Republicans. The problem is that a lot of these people either feel abortion is not something the government should be involved with, or they are straight-up pro-life. Mr. Biden's flip on the Hyde Amendment makes it very difficult for these people to vote Democratic.", "categories": [["Opinion", "Letters"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/opinion?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/letters?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/equity-for-baseball-players-would-be-a-major-error-11560540899", "title": "Equity for Baseball Players Would Be a Major Error", "date": "2019-06-14 15:35", "summary": "If a player owns equity in team A, but then is traded to team B, what incentives might arise when he has to play team A in a big game?.
