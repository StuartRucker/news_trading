I disagree with at least one of author Michael Moss's assertions cited in Matthew Rees's review of \"Hooked\" (Bookshelf, March 12). Mr. Moss writes that part of the reason the obesity rate in the U.S. has risen to 42.4% is: \"When women moved into the workplace . . . there was less time at home to devote to cooking.\" It would be more accurate to say that when women joined the workforce, there was no ensuing redistribution of cooking duties in many homes. This would assign responsibility for the lack of home-cooking more accurately-to working men and women.", "categories": [["Opinion", "Letters"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/opinion?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/letters?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/republicans-need-to-face-the-issues-raised-by-h-r-1-11616098378", "title": "Republicans Need to Face the Issues Raised by H.R. 1", "date": "2021-03-18 16:12", "summary": "Whatever the demerits of H.R. 1, it is indisputably about expanding access to the ballot box, and the question Republicans must answer is why this is a bad thing..

Her answer isn't that such expanded and more uniform access would increase the risk of voter fraud as compared with the current hodgepodge of state laws, but rather that it would \"rig the game for a permanent Democratic majority.\" But if having more people cast votes really means that Republicans will lose more elections, shouldn't they be examining why this is so and formulating policies that appeal to more voters, rather than fighting what appears to be a rear-guard battle against majority rule?

Benedict Cumberbatch is Greville Wynne, a British civilian recruited by MI6 and the CIA to travel to Moscow and make covert contact with Oleg Penkovsky (Merab Ninidze), a Soviet military intelligence colonel who wants to help the West avoid a shooting war.
