In 1937, John Steinbeck began to be disturbed by unannounced visitors at the small cottage north of Monterey that he shared with his wife Carol. Steinbeck had just published \"Of Mice and Men,\" which he wrote at the kitchen table beside an open wood stove during the daylight hours, because the kerosene lamp gave him eyestrain. They had no telephone; when the stage play Steinbeck adapted with George S. Kaufman premiered on Broadway, he and Carol had to drive five miles to a neighbor's house to hear how it was received. The sudden appearance of fans at his front door upended their spartan, happily impoverished life. Steinbeck built walls around the property and removed the sign with his name at the entrance. Zeppo Marx tried to reach him and Steinbeck refused to get back in touch. But he was sufficiently awed when Charlie Chaplin showed up one day in a stretch limo. They got along well, though Chaplin thought it strange that the Steinbecks didn't have maids to do the cleaning.", "categories": [["Books & Arts", "Books", "Bookshelf"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts/books?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/bookshelf?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-and-president-trump-what-scientists-know-about-effects-on-the-body-treatments-11601669079", "title": "Covid-19 and President Trump: What Scientists Know About Effects on the Body, Treatments", "date": "2020-10-02 19:48", "summary": "Doctors have learned more about how the virus impacts the body, effective treatments and how to prevent its spread.
