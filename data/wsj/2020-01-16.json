In Carol Tavris's \"Beyond Fertility\" review (Bookshelf, Jan. 10) of Susan P. Mattern's \"The Slow Moon Climbs,\" there is no mention of the most compelling reason for the menopause in our species. I refer to the fact that for optimal success and survival-human infants need a mother for a long period (compared with most other species). It takes 15 years or more for children to become self-sufficient and no longer in urgent need of maternal (and paternal) support and guidance. Lifespan tended to be much shorter in bygone times than it is currently. In times when a mother could scarcely count on living past 50, having a child at 45 or 48, with the mother dying a few years later, would represent a serious evolutionary disadvantage to our species: babies losing their mothers prematurely, when they could barely walk or feed themselves, let alone take their place in society. It would appear, then, that menopause developed as an evolutionary advantage to enhance the likelihood that children would have their mothers until they reached self-sufficiency. The brilliant and remarkable Ruth Bader Ginsburg, were she to have a child next year, would have to live to 105 to see the child off to college. Not a likely scenario.
