For example, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Samsung have both perfected five nanometer (5 nm) chip processes, whereas Intel is still stuck on its 10 nm process. Smaller chip processes result in smaller chips, lower voltages, less power consumption, and less heat to be dissipated.
