From the early 1960s to today, the world of Marvel superheroes has seen its fan base grow from an inner circle of comic-book addicts to, well, seemingly everybody. Beginning with the first issue of The Fantastic Four, in 1961, readers have followed the serialized adventures of characters who possess both extra-human abilities and the quintessentially human quality of vulnerability. The bitter, rock-skinned, immensely strong Thing of the Fantastic Four; the green-skinned, enraged, even more immensely strong Hulk; and, especially, the perpetually tormented Spider-Man-these are among the often confused, not-always-heroic heroes whose adventures drew an increasingly sophisticated readership during a decade that brought real-world confusion of its own. Some have observed that with the expansion of Marvel's universe over the decades, particularly through the many recent top-grossing movies based on the comic books, Marvel has moved from the counterculture deep into the culture itself, becoming a colossal, ongoing, near-mythological epic made up of many, many characters whose narrative arcs frequently intertwine in fascinating, sometimes bewildering ways. Latecomers, especially moviegoers who want to read the comics for a deeper understanding of the \"cinematic universe\" they have come to love, may ask: Where do I start?", "categories": [["Books & Arts", "Books", "Bookshelf"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts/books?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/bookshelf?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chanel-no-5-perfume-fashion-book-review-coco-chanel-catching-lightning-in-a-bottle-11637336305", "title": "'Chanel No. 5' Review: Catching Lightning in a Bottle", "date": "2021-11-19 15:08", "summary": "Coco Chanel wanted a signature perfume to accompany her modern fashions.
