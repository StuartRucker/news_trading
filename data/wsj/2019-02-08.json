It holds that if left free of exogenous forces, any affinity group will naturally evolve a hierarchal network inherently structured to maximize the desired output of the group. One can envision a theoretical curve plotting group output versus hierarchal complexity. At zero hierarchy, individuals act disparately and the uncoordinated group output is minimal. At 100% hierarchy, no one is left in the group to do the work required to generate any output. Between the two extremes, the curve reaches an apex where the complexity of the hierarchal network in size and shape is just right to yield maximum group output.
