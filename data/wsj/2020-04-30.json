He's fearless when it comes to learning new skills. By contrast, I just retired after 21 years in the private sector as a Cobol programmer. When I suggested to my colleagues some of the newer technologies that my son was learning, they were quickly discarded because the current managers either didn't know about them or were afraid of losing their jobs to a new system. This was all put into perspective as I watched my wife work for a county government on a mainframe that made my system look like it came from the future.
