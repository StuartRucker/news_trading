A world in which everyone can kill everyone else would breed massive individual and collective insecurity, and private contracts are not sufficient to either secure bodily integrity or protect property rights. There are impossible transactional obstacles in asking every person, born or unborn, to independently make arrangements with all others on these critical topics.
