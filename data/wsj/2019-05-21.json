His quiet discretion is just one of the ways he earns the trust of his portrait subjects. Last summer, I was fortunate enough to attend Mikael's 60th birthday party at the Tuscan retreat he and his wife, Lotta, renovated together, a gorgeous property that reflects their shared passion for decorating houses. I knew our readers would be as dazzled as I was to get an inside look at how their beautiful home came together, as documented by Mikael himself; thankfully, in the end he consented.
