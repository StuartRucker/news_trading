For some African-American writers, New York's uptown neighborhood of Harlem represents both a crucible and a showcase. Writing about Harlem has been known to launch literary careers, for those good enough to capture something of the vibrancy and rich history, the majesty and appalling poverty, the sounds, smells and feel of the place-its growth in the early 20th century into the capital of Black America, with the nation's largest concentration of African-Americans; the birth, in the 1920s, of the Harlem Renaissance, an explosive movement of literature, art and music; the continued tough economic times and resulting crime; the quiet majority of citizens who work hard in the daytime and return to their families in the evening. But how to evoke, in the words of Ann Petry, this \"hodgepodge of churches, bars, beauty parlors [and] harsh orange-red neon signs,\" this lush urban world \"as varied and as full of ambivalences as Manhattan itself\"? Many writers have taken up the challenge. The Jamaican-born Claude McKay published the novel \"Home to Harlem\" in 1928, and the action in Nella Larsen's 1929 classic \"Passing\" takes place in Harlem. Ralph Ellison set part of his groundbreaking 1952 novel \"Invisible Man\" there; Chester Himes chose the neighborhood as the backdrop for a series of slim, zany, biting, frequently hilarious crime novels featuring the detectives Grave Digger Jones and Coffin Ed Johnson, among them \"Cotton Comes to Harlem\" (1965). Unlike all of those writers, James Baldwin grew up in Harlem and-for all the time he spent abroad-in some ways never left, writing about his birthplace in essays such as the immortal \"Notes of a Native Son\" and in fiction including his first novel, \"Go Tell It on the Mountain\" (1953). Works by contemporary writers include Sharifa Rhodes-Pitts's 2011 nonfiction book \"Harlem Is Nowhere,\" whose title is taken from an Ellison essay.
