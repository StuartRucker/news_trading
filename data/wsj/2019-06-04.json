Eight design pros duke it out. INTRODUCING soothing wood in a room of hard, shiny materials like porcelain and polished metals is a lovely old trick. Why not the tub? The earthy colors and irregular grain would warm up and customize a traditionally sterile space, said New York interior designer Gia Sharp approvingly. Tina Ramchandani, a fellow New York designer, also said she'd welcome a lumber tub: \"Bathing in a natural element such as wood is more inviting and luxurious than cold ceramic.\" It doesn't hurt that this visually comforting material is literally toasty too. \"Wood retains heat longer, so wood tubs are perfect for lingering in and melting stress knots,\" said Ms. Sharp. New-breed wood tubs (this year's International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York featured two) are influenced less by the traditional Japanese ofuro-defined by high, thin walls and a built-in seat-and more by dugout canoes and vintage clawfoots. (Witness, for example, the sensuous curves and sprawling dimensions of the cedar soaker inset above, from Italian manufacturer e-legno). Still, Japanese bathing culture, with roots in Buddhist purification rituals, remains relevant. \"The idea of bath as spa is not new, but a wood tub evokes bathing as a spiritual experience,\" said architect John Ike of San Francisco's Ike Kligerman Barkley, who installed one in a Richmond, Calif., project.
