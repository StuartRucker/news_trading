Forster and John Maynard Keynes. But as Wendy Hitchmough, an English curator and lecturer, points out, over a 60-year period \"Bloomsbury self-fashioned a visual identity that consolidated and promoted its position as an influential group of radicals.\" In \"The Bloomsbury Look\" (Yale, 183 pages, $40) she offers a thorough consideration of what these daring bohemians wore, photographed, designed, painted and promoted. The group early on embraced amateur photography \"to frame and to share private, uninhibited identities,\" including nude frolics inspired by Nijinsky. Far from eschewing the attentions of the mainstream press, the radicals cultivated a wider social circle that included two of British Vogue's top editors, who were \"keen to craft a connection between fashion and the avant-garde.\" Perhaps the most tangible aspect of a Bloomsbury \"look\" evolved at the Omega Workshops, nurtured by Fry and Bell, who enlisted like-minded artisans to design furniture, textiles and household goods. Omega's \"extreme, Cubist clothing and its unconventional dresses projected a distinctive, public identity\" for the Bloomsbury Group and its friends.
