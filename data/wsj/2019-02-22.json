In August 1772, a little more than a month into Capt. Cook's second voyage around the world, Cook's men noticed that a small bird was following them: Hirundo rustica, commonly known as the barn swallow. In the confused swallow's mind, HMS Resolution had become land, and the bird could not be persuaded otherwise. At night, it would roost in one of the gun ports or the woodwork of the stern; during the day, unfazed by the incessant rain, it resumed its aimless travel. Georg Forster, the 17-year-old son of the expedition's official naturalist, took pity on the soggy animal. He dried it and let it loose in the steerage, where it feasted on flies. Soon the swallow came and went as it pleased. But then, as suddenly as it had shown up, it was gone.
