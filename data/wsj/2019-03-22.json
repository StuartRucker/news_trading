There are few ways to leave a gang while in prison: death or removal from the general population (the latter option obviously being more appealing to inmate gang-affiliates looking for an out).", "categories": [["Opinion", "Letters"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/opinion?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/letters?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/maybe-nonprofit-colleges-should-guarantee-results-11553285020", "title": "Maybe Nonprofit Colleges Should Guarantee Results", "date": "2019-03-22 16:03", "summary": "Mark Zuckerman writes: \"For-profit colleges claim that they provide students with quality education.\" Perhaps in a follow-up letter Mr. Zuckerman can explain how for-profit colleges differ from private and public colleges in these respects..
