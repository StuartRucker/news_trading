In these times of pandemic, it is easy to understand why solitary confinement is considered by many to be torture: lockdowns and social isolation have challenged the well-being of us all.

The wife of the English landscape architect Tom Stuart-Smith, she began married life as a gardening skeptic, having long viewed tending the soil as \"outdoor housework.\" Over time she became an enthusiast, inspired by watching seeds germinate and new life come into being. Drawing upon scientific data and case studies to make her case for \"the restorative power of nature,\" she describes the profound, positive effect of gardening and green spaces on everyone, including, for example, prisoners on New York's Rikers Island, who when assigned to a professional gardening project are statistically unlikely to return upon release, some even finding work in public parks. To reinforce her point, she skillfully weaves into her narrative a rich, idiosyncratic mix of archeological evidence of man's earliest gardens, quotations from Scripture and the great books, and anecdotes from her own psychotherapy practice. She describes planting a single bulb as \"setting a little time bomb of hope in motion,\" and calls a garden a place not of retreat but of refuge. Instead of the Latin motto veritas, \"truth,\" she prefers St. Hildegard's viriditas, \"green and truth,\" the \"connection between the human spirit and the growth force of the earth.\" In closing, she says that \"now, more than ever, we need to remind ourselves that, first and foremost, we are creatures of the earth.\"", "categories": [["Books & Arts", "Books", "Bookshelf"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts/books?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/bookshelf?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fairness-is-an-issue-in-cap-gains-tax-at-death-11617905844", "title": "Fairness Is an Issue in Cap Gains Tax at Death", "date": "2021-04-08 14:17", "summary": "Establishing basis for many items and maintaining basis records on many types of property over many decades made it impractical.. Regarding \"Exclusion Seen in Capital-Gains Tax Plan\" (U.S. News, March 30): A provision of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 required a carry-over basis for assets transferred at death; however, it never came into effect. It was delayed in 1978 and repealed in 1980. Among other reasons for its repeal were concerns regarding the fact that establishing basis for many items and maintaining basis records on many types of property over many decades made it impractical. It would be grossly unfair to eliminate the current benefits of stepped-up basis after the first $1 million of gains when people, for many years, haven't had the incentive or requirement to keep detailed basis records on many types of long-held assets. Some might propose that it be eliminated on a prospective basis and applied to assets acquired only after the date of enactment. Others might suggest that it not be allowed for assets always held in a brokerage account where basis information has always been maintained.
