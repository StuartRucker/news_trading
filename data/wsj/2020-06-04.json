The film, directed by Josephine Decker and adapted by Sarah Gubbins from a novel by Susan Scarf Merrell, conjures clumsily with its own gothic tropes in a 1960s academic setting. It's a horror story with a feminist agenda about Jackson's tumultuous marriage to the writer and critic Stanley Edgar Hyman. She's blocked, and a slatternly boozer. He's a flagrant philanderer and, as played by Michael Stuhlbarg, an insufferable pedant. They depend on each other in intricate ways, yet take pleasure in driving each other to the brink. For all its verbal combat, and marital strife that's echoed and amplified by a younger academic couple in the manner of \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf,\" the story works best when the dialogue tides subside. In those fleeting moments Ms. Moss is able to convey, eloquently and almost wordlessly, a tormented soul.", "categories": [["Books & Arts", "Film Review"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/film-review?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/anno-domino-review-no-stage-no-problem-11591300960", "title": "'Anno Domino' Review: No Stage?
