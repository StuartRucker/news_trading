Students in many universities have been taught that civility is a tool to reinforce white patriarchy and therefore part of America's systemic-racism problem, not part of the solution. Civility allegedly patronizes people of color and is used to deflect expression of legitimate grievances. If you shake hands with a privileged person, it merely signals egalitarian virtue that doesn't exist in a racist American society.
