It is the principle. Speaker Pelosi now looks like a hypocrite and should have known better. No one owes her an apology. It is she who owes the salon owner, as well as the American people, an apology for putting her own selfish needs above those of everyone else and for putting the hair salon in jeopardy.", "categories": [["Opinion", "Letters"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/opinion?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/letters?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-federal-role-in-anti-covid-19-supplies-11599680839", "title": "The Federal Role in Anti-Covid-19 Supplies", "date": "2020-09-09 15:47", "summary": "Can you imagine the chaos that would've resulted from the federal government's attempt to allocate supplies between the states?. \"'Try Getting It Yourselves': How Administration Sowed Supply Chaos\" (Page One, Sept. 1) includes this sentence: \"It isn't possible to know whether a more centralized federal response to the coronavirus pandemic would have worked better.\" Yet the article basically makes the case that centralized federal logistics support was needed and necessary but didn't happen.
