James. (This installment is titled \"Shroud for a Nightingale\"; two more adaptations, \"The Black Tower\" and \"A Taste for Death,\" will follow.) The victim is a trainee on whom another student demonstrates the insertion of a feeding tube-a fatal exercise that pumps her full of toxins. Mr. Carvel is the third actor to portray the detective (Roy Marsden who originated the role in the 1980s). The tale, set in mid-1970s England-each installment spans a pair of episodes, two of which roll out on Mondays for three weeks-is never less than gripping in its picture of medical procedures gone wrong, evidently by design. The visual impact-the young trainee reacting to the worst physical anguish imaginable, the chief medical instructor covered in blood-is terrorizing. The atmosphere of dread and depression is pervasive in the drama. We begin to suspect that any tube in a patient's mouth may well not be delivering the medication the doctors had intended-that it just might be transmitting a corrosive substance that kills.
