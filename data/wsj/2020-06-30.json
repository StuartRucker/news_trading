But if that's not an option, your best bet is to rely on a credit card, according to Megan McCoy, director of the financial planning master's program at Kansas State University. First, she recommends comparison shopping and understanding the annual percentage rate, or APR, which is the the annual interest rate you'll have to pay on top of your balance. You'll almost certainly have to pay back more than you borrowed.
