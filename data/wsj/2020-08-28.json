Evie Wyld's 2013 novel \"All the Birds, Singing\" opened with a description of a savaged sheep that was so realistic that it seemed to perfume the air with blood. Ms. Wyld's new novel, \"The Bass Rock,\" delivers a similarly immediate jolt, though this time the corpse is human and gruesomely packaged. \"Resting in a rock pool was a black suitcase, bulging at the sides,\" the narrator recalls of her childhood discovery, and you can imagine the rest. A cloud of flies rises, \"thick and heavy,\" along with a smell \"so tall and so broad that you can't see over or around it.\" Hardly inviting. Indeed, in the hands of a more conventional writer, the effect would be repellent. But throughout Ms. Wyld's fiction, which transcends the category of either horror or crime, such visceral images, always sparingly employed, have a mesmerizing force that is instantly felt and eerily sustained. Whether the location is the Australian outback (\"After the Fire, a Still Small Voice\"), rural England and Australia (\"All the Birds, Singing\") or coastal Scotland (\"The Bass Rock\"), this author seizes her readers with the swift grace of the wild predators she often describes, then sets them down on terrain so richly imagined it seems to fill the senses. Here, for example, is a Scottish beach in winter: \"A mix of black rock and pale cold sand . . . the top layer of sand skittering away, so that it looked like a giant bed sheet billowing.\" And later, a sea sketch: \"The clouds had dropped down low and the sky turned a dark yellow, suggesting snow. . . . The water blackened, and quickened, sending sharp little waves with white at their blades towards the shore.\"", "categories": [["Books & Arts", "Books", "Bookshelf"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts/books?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/bookshelf?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mysteries-corporate-scandal-in-the-city-of-light-11598622787", "title": "Mysteries: Corporate Scandal in the City of Light", "date": "2020-08-28 09:53", "summary": "In Louise Penny's latest, Chief Inspector Armand Gamache of the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Quebec travels to Paris on vacation but ends up investigating an attack on his godfather..

For Jane Keltner de Valle, style director at Architectural Digest, and her husband, architect and designer Giancarlo Valle, necessity was indeed the mother of invention. When their son, Roman, now 6, was a baby, he suffered from eczema, and the Valles were often shocked by the recommendations dermatologists gave them. \"It was all packed with so many questionable ingredients,\" says Jane. They realized there was a gap in the children's skin-care market, so they decided to create Paloroma, a product line made with natural soothers like colloidal oatmeal, Roman chamomile extract and shea butter. Jane describes it as \"pure and transparent in its ingredients, but not dumbed down in its design.\" It took the Valles some time to find the right lab that shared their commitment to avoiding parabens, phthalates, silicones, sulfates, dyes, petrolatum and scents. When they finally partnered with a company in Vermont, the biggest hurdle was fragrance, or rather, the lack of it. Even natural ingredients have smells, which compels brands to use scent as a masking agent. After a lot of trial and error, Paloroma is launching this fall with a trio of products: a cream, cleansing bar and wash. While many children's skin-care lines are baby-focused, the Valles want Paloroma to be transitional. \"The products are something that kids can grow up with,\" Giancarlo explains. And offering approachable pricing ($12-$25) was also im-portant to them. \"We bathe our children pretty much every day, so we know how much you're using these things,\" says Jane. \"We didn't want parents to feel like they had to be precious with it and just use a drop.\" paloroma.com", "categories": [["What's News"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/types/magazine-what-s-news?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/phil-swift-of-infomercial-fame-buys-florida-home-for-20-million-11598616959", "title": "Phil Swift of Infomercial Fame Buys Florida Home for $20 Million", "date": "2020-08-28 08:16", "summary": "The man behind products like Flex Seal and Flex Paste bought the Gulf Stream home just a few days after it hit the market.
