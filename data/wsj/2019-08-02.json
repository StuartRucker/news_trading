In 1896, the United States was suffering through one of the worst financial crises in its history. American society was bitterly divided, by region, party and class. At the same time, scientists were warning of looming ecological disaster in the nation's forests, but politicians refused to act. In \"Natural Rivals,\" John Clayton relates how, against this backdrop, two giants of environmental history, John Muir and Gifford Pinchot, worked to break the stalemate-in the process reshaping America's idea of its public lands and perhaps even providing a model for how to confront our own impending climatic catastrophe.", "categories": [["Books & Arts", "Books", "Bookshelf"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts/books?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/bookshelf?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/july-jobs-report-does-little-to-clarify-fed-outlook-muddled-by-escalated-trade-tensions-11564758479", "title": "Jobs Report Does Little to Clarify Fed Outlook Muddled By Escalated Trade Tensions", "date": "2019-08-02 11:11", "summary": "Steady hiring and wages didn't deter a quarter-point rate cut this week.

Enslaved, forcibly converted to Islam and discouraged from marriage, the boys would receive rigorous physical training and form the ranks of the Janissaries, an elite corps of soldiers directly serving the Ottoman sultan. A few would rise to positions of power, and thus some families paid bribes to secure entry into the system for their male children. For many other families, however, devshirme was viewed as a catastrophe; they did what they could to resist such brutal seizure, including the arrangement of childhood marriages and even disfigurement.
