A: Serene river ships, with their violin quartets and bookish shore guides, tend to accommodate about 150 passengers, so chances are indeed lower that you'll contract coronavirus on those kind of vessels than, say, a 5,000-passenger ocean liner, laden with spin classes and Martini bars. Simply put: You'll be exposed to fewer people and can more easily keep your distance. That's one reason the CDC's ban on cruise ships sailing in U.S. waters-through September, at the least-does not apply to vessels carrying fewer than 250 people. The handful of small ships that are sailing now, including the AmaKristina, which plies Germany's Rhine, are carrying less than their typical passenger load. But don't pack your deck shoes quite yet. The number of other people on board-even if they're all masked up at the breakfast buffet-isn't the only variable, said Dr. Edward Ryan, director of global infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. \"Where are the other passengers and crew coming from? From a high-risk environment? How much time will you spend indoors? And even if everyone came aboard without an infection, if they get off at ports, what's the likelihood that they'll bring it back to the ship? Those are just a few variables. We can probably think of 20 more,\" said Dr. Ryan, adding that he personally wouldn't risk a cruise vacation of any kind right now.
