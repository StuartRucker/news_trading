Losers aren't usually popular. But the curious thing about the New York Mets is that they were massively, wildly, inexplicably popular long before they achieved anything like success, setting records for most losses in a season while trouncing their more-winning cross-town rivals, the Yankees, at the gate. Going into the 1969 season, the odds that the Mets would win the World Series were 100-1. That's about all you need to know to understand the thrill that must have accompanied their fitful path to victory that year. They were known as the Miracle Mets, but there was nothing miraculous at work here, as Wayne Coffey demonstrates in \"They Said It Couldn't Be Done\" (Crown, 289 pages, $28), his excellent book on the Mets' championship season. The 1969 Mets were young and untested, but with Gerry Gentry, Jerry Koosman, Tom Seaver and relievers Nolan Ryan and Tug McGraw, they had the best pitching in baseball-the wider world just didn't know it yet. They also had a manager, Gil Hodges, who optimized a fine, if not superstar, cadre of position players into a dominant team. The team's core was strong, no doubt: Tommie Agee, Jerry Grote, Bud Harrelson, Cleon Jones and, toward the end of the season, Donn Clendenon. But Mr. Coffey argues convincingly that it was Hodges' ability to put his part-time players to work that was the real key to the team's success. And Hodges's genius wasn't merely tactical: He valued his players and appreciated that each of them had a contribution to make.", "categories": [["Books & Arts", "Books", "Bookshelf"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts/books?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/bookshelf?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/summer-books-2019-camping-11558703636", "title": "Summer Books 2019: Camping", "date": "2019-05-24 09:13", "summary": "Books about fire-starting, knot-tying, jerky-making and other bushcraft.. Miles Tanner's \"Building the Perfect Fire: With or Without Matches in Any Weather\" (Black Dog & Leventhal, 124 pages, $16.99) takes a pretty straightforward look at combustion-our history with it, the different ways to create and sustain it, how to safely use it. But the title is curious for a couple of reasons. Since fire is dynamic and ever-changing, \"perfect\" doesn't apply. As for making fire without matches in any weather, sure, as long as you've got a lighter. The author wisely advises carrying both matches (wood, strike-anywhere) and a lighter (butane). While 4-foot-wide Inuit ice lenses, bamboo fire saws and fire pistons have been used in aboriginal cultures for millennia, they require ungodly amounts of practice. You don't want to bet your life on them. Unfortunately, Mr. Tanner makes just enough mistakes to rattle one's confidence. He says a hunter can use powder from a shotgun shell and a rifle scope lens to start a blaze. Thing is, shotguns aren't rifles. They don't carry scopes. The entry on tinder is inadequate. Without good tinder, fire is impossible. And, inexplicably, it's in the chapter on \"Heat\" rather than \"Fuel.\" An illustration of a hand drill shows some other, far more complex mechanism. And a sidebar lauding steel wool as \"a virtual lifesaver\" mentions it only as a means of coaxing a spark from a battery.

It's one in a series of offbeat scenes in the film: the hum of servers at Swiss physics lab CERN, a hand smacking Jell-O, machinery plowing a potato field. These dissimilar clips echo themes long present in Rottenberg's work-notions of the body, the material world and the creation of value. Rottenberg approaches these topics with a certain playfulness, twisting the familiar to emphasize the folly of modern life. In her world, women mash up cut fingernails into maraschino cherries or stare at computers surrounded by garish inflatable toys. \"Part of the humor is the complexity of the situation,\" Rottenberg, 42, says. \"When you deal with heavy themes, [you must] allow for that.
