Regarding Barton Swaim's review of Nicholas Lemann's \"Transaction Man\" (Bookshelf, Sept. 12): It is amusing to see Mr. Lemann and others on the left wax nostalgic about the U.S. economy in the 1950s when privileged, white, male technocrats in government colluded with privileged, white, male CEOs to generously share corporate profits with union employees and Washington tax collectors. The good ol' days ended when countries that were decimated during World War II recovered and their businesses began to clean corporate America's clock. By the 1970s, U.S. corporate leaders had to worry about profit margins, growth and shareholder value, and that is when \"transaction man\" climbed the ladder to squeeze unions and make money for stockholders.", "categories": [["Opinion", "Letters"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/opinion?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/letters?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-late-paul-ingrassia-was-a-class-act-all-around-11569359891", "title": "The Late Paul Ingrassia Was a Class Act All Around", "date": "2019-09-24 17:18", "summary": "Your editorial \"Paul Ingrassia\" regarding the renowned journalist omits one very descriptive word-scholar..
