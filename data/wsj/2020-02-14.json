Next to it, in the rear, Logozo was my first breakthrough album and my first full-length one with a major label. In front, that 1962 Neumann U 67 microphone-whooo, it sounds so good. I have such a dynamic voice: I can go very low, I can go very soft, and I can belt it out. Not many microphones can take all of those different types of voices and deliver it as pure and as warm and as beautiful as I give it. On the far left, my mom, when my baby, Na\u00efma, was born, came all the way from Benin with these pink buckets. The way we wash a newborn in Benin is very particular: When you're giving a bath you remold the child's body. It takes an hour and the baby's like clay. Inside the bucket, one of the Polaroids is of me starting my career, full of hope, fearless, on tour. The community that you create on tour is so important for the music you play onstage. Those bracelets in front were made specifically for my album Ay\u00e9. We had to copy the jewelry because it was too expensive for me to buy at the time. I had another fearless look-like an Amazonian but completely modern. The Paris Match magazine photo is from 2018, when I was asked to sing in Paris for the centennial of the First World War. I accepted on the condition that I would be there to pay tribute to the African soldiers who died for peace and the democracy we live in today. In the back, those drums are amazing because they have many different notes depending on where you hit them. You can't hit them with strong, rigid sticks. It has to be very soft, like with your hands, very gentle. With the square drum, you have to see it played to understand the ingenuity of human beings to create instruments and to express emotion.\"", "categories": [["Still Life"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/types/magazine-still-life?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-banking-behemoth-changes-a-300-year-old-brand-tainted-by-crisis-11581678520", "title": "Former Banking Behemoth Changes a 300-Year-Old Brand Tainted by Crisis", "date": "2020-02-14 06:08", "summary": "Royal Bank of Scotland will alter its name in a bid to move on from the legacy of the global financial crisis.
