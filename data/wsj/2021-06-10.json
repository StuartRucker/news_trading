On the most superficial level-and superficial levels can be enjoyable-\"Sublet\" is a cautionary tale about the perils of the Airbnb age. However it may have been advertised on whatever international website, the little Tel Aviv apartment at the center of Eytan Fox's rueful comedy, in English and subtitled Hebrew, is a dump, and a horrible letdown for Michael (John Benjamin Hickey), the weary, 50-something journalist from New York who climbs the stairway to its front door. Worse still, the apartment's owner, a young Israeli named Tomer (Niv Nissim), has only the dimmest concept of boundaries. He keeps coming back to retrieve stuff he needs, and, truth to tell, he doesn't have anywhere else to stay. Thus does the film, playing in select theaters, find its true level, its operating altitude. It's a gentle, often funny meditation on advancing age and the fragile joys of youth.", "categories": [["Books & Arts", "Film Review"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/books-arts?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/film-review?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-a-16-year-old-made-1-7-million-in-revenue-reselling-scarce-goods-11623360165", "title": "How a 16-Year-Old Made $1.7 Million in Revenue Reselling Scarce Goods", "date": "2021-06-10 17:22", "summary": "High-school junior Max Hayden has been flipping PlayStations, Pokemon cards and more for big profits.
