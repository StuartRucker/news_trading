IN ITS MIDCENTURY boom years, when Motown ruled the airwaves and the big three ruled the roads, Detroit defined America. But, in the subsequent decades, no city fell farther, or harder. Now a much-publicized revival is unfolding there. Downtown is a hive of construction, its sidewalks buzzing with tech-bros and tourists on app-enabled electric scooters (at least until they randomly discard them). Neighborhoods like Midtown (n\u00e9e Cass Corridor) and the West Village are rebounding with ambitious new bars and restaurants, many served by urban farms which have sprouted where houses once stood. Though the hollowing out that made those farms possible is still an issue (the city's population today is just below 700,000, sharply off its 1950s peak of 1.8 million people), rampant development has become an equally pressing concern for many Detroiters. Even the city's industrial ruins, like the old Packard Plant, which have aged into beloved icons for many, are targeted for restoration. The time to appreciate them is now. Taking in everything that Motor City has to offer over the course of a long weekend is challenging. As the T-shirts say, Detroit Hustles Harder. You'll have to adopt the same motto if you want to fit it all in, but feel free to opt out of our ambitious itinerary now and then.", "categories": [["Life & Work", "Travel", "Off Duty Travel"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/life-work?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/magazine/travel?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/off-duty-travel?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/help-us-stranger-by-the-raconteurs-and-lets-rock-by-the-black-keys-reviews-two-takes-on-rock-classicism-11560973040", "title": "'Help Us Stranger' by the Raconteurs and 'Let's Rock' by the Black Keys Reviews: Two Takes on Rock Classicism", "date": "2019-06-19 15:37", "summary": "Jack White helms an album of eccentric, self-aware romanticism; the guitar-heavy duo cuts a back-to-basics record of masterful style..
