Regarding your editorial \"Visas for Hong Kong\" (May 30): President Trump's statement of solidarity with Hong Kong is welcome, but bringing the human talent of Hong Kong to the U.S. would be a substantive policy change that you believe would enhance America, hurt China and stun critics of his otherwise anti-immigration rhetoric and policies. The election-year political effect of a pro-immigration shock might not be worth the risk. President Trump's critics are unlikely to change their minds, the bold move will be portrayed as a stunt by most in the media and his base may not appreciate his wavering on immigration, especially when many of his supporters are unemployed because of the pandemic.", "categories": [["Opinion", "Letters"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/opinion?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/types/letters?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/return-of-the-jobs-boom-11591379703", "title": "Return of the Jobs Boom", "date": "2020-06-05 13:59", "summary": "May's great hiring news sparks another media conspiracy theory..
