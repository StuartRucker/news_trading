The global cosmetics industry produces 120 billion units of packaging every year. Almost one third of the garbage in U.S. landfills is from containers and packaging. Statistics like these have inspired eco-conscious beauty brands to reconsider their packaging footprint. When Michelle Feeney started her fragrance line Floral Street, she applied the same principle to both her natural ingredients and her packaging: Everything is sustainably sourced. \"[The box] leaves no trace, even if it does end up in a landfill,\" she notes. Skin-care brand Ayond conducted a life-cycle assessment of its raw materials to help guide sourcing and disposal. \"We developed a recycling program to handle packaging waste, not just from Ayond but from any other beauty brand,\" says co-founder Shani Van Breukelen. Organic makeup brand Kjaer Weis and skin-care purveyor Follain were early adopters of the refillable model; recently, hair-color brand Bleach London has incorporated refillable glass bottles, and personal-care startup By Humankind has a refillable system for its deodorant, shampoo and mouthwash. But the biggest challenge for brands may not be cutting back on packaging, but cutting back period. \"The beauty industry really needs to take a look at just how many products it produces,\" says Feeney.", "categories": [["What's News"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/types/magazine-what-s-news?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-co-founder-of-allbirds-always-exercises-before-his-flight-11565959195", "title": "Why The Co-Founder of Allbirds Always Exercises Before His Flight", "date": "2019-08-16 08:39", "summary": "Former pro athlete and shoe company co-founder Tim Brown on making a long trip back home, his versatile travel wardrobe and the reading habit his colleagues make fun of.
