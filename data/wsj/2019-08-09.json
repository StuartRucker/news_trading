The German-made gas-powered infrared-cooking machine can heat up to its maximum temperature of 1500 degrees in 3 minutes. A little larger than a toaster oven, the compact grill was engineered with steak in mind-specifically, to achieve a steakhouse-quality sear at home-and that it does, with astonishing results. In a few minutes, a rib-eye sports a caramelized crust and a soft-as-butter center. The device also doubles, quite adeptly, as a pizza oven. In 5 minutes, a Neapolitan-style pie comes out exactly as you want it: charred in spots and fluffy on the inside, with a pool of molten cheese on top. Very good things actually can come to those who don't wait. $1,195, ottogrills.com", "categories": [["Life & Work", "Food & Drink"]], "category_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/news/life-work?mod=breadcrumb", "https://www.wsj.com/news/life-work/food-cooking-drink?mod=breadcrumb"]}, {"link": "https://www.wsj.com/articles/political-gambits-threaten-more-economic-upheaval-in-europe-11565374304", "title": "Political Gambits Threaten More Economic Upheaval in Europe", "date": "2019-08-09 14:16", "summary": "U.K. leader's Brexit pledge and Italian push for power are set to test region's economies.
